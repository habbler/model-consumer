# Project Status

## Snapshot (October 31, 2025)
- Specification and implementation plan completed (`docs/Specification.md`, `docs/ImplementationPlan.md`).
- Repository guidelines published (`AGENTS.md`) and contributor workflow established.
- Numeric stack committed to Hasktorch tensors; awaiting wiring in source modules.

## Current Focus
- Phase P1 (Foundations & Utilities) from the implementation plan.
  - Define tensor-backed type aliases and helper combinators.
  - Introduce configuration stubs for environment matrices (`MatrixEnv`).
  - Add domain error types to anchor validation pathways.

## Recent Milestones
- Formalized design scope and architecture in the updated specification.
- Captured phased roadmap and next-actions in the implementation plan.
- Verified that web search tooling is available for sourcing Hasktorch references.

## Next Actions
1. Finalize default Hasktorch dtype/device settings and settle the `Env` structure.
2. Scaffold initial `src/Core` module layout with Haddock headers.
3. Add baseline tests (placeholder `hspec` modules) to ensure CI wiring is ready for P1 deliverables.

## Risks & Flags
- Hasktorch dependency integration may require toolchain setup verification on contributor machines.
- Market dynamics and tensor helpers remain unimplemented; avoid deriving downstream modules until P1 completes.
