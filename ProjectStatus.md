# Project Status

## Snapshot (October 31, 2025)
- Specification and implementation plan completed (`docs/Specification.md`, `docs/ImplementationPlan.md`).
- Repository guidelines published (`AGENTS.md`) and contributor workflow established.
- Numeric stack currently prototyped with lightweight tensor/matrix facades; Hasktorch swap planned in later phases.

## Current Focus
- Phase P1 (Foundations & Utilities) from the implementation plan.
  - Define tensor-backed type aliases and helper combinators. **Status:** tensor and matrix facades implemented (`Core.Tensor`, `Core.Matrix`).
  - Introduce configuration stubs for environment matrices (`MatrixEnv`). **Status:** `Core.Config` provides validated defaults.
  - Add domain error types to anchor validation pathways. **Status:** consolidated in `Core.Error` and consumed by core types.
  - Prototype need evolution helpers. **Status:** `Core.Dynamics` offers time/spend/rebound transitions with tests.
  - Introduce world scaffolding. **Status:** `Core.World` builds validated world states (prices, wage, env).
  - Prototype agent step. **Status:** `Core.Agent.stepAgent` updates needs/money with tests.
  - Introduce basic world stepping. **Status:** `Core.Simulation.stepWorld` batches agent updates.

## Recent Milestones
- Formalized design scope and architecture in the updated specification.
- Captured phased roadmap and next-actions in the implementation plan.
- Verified that web search tooling is available for sourcing Hasktorch references.

## Next Actions
1. Extend `Core.Types` with world structures (prices, wages) and integrate `Core.Dynamics` in a step function.
2. Flesh out observation/policy scaffolding after basic world state updates are available.
3. Gradually migrate manual harness to `hspec` while preserving fast feedback.

## Risks & Flags
- Hasktorch dependency integration may require toolchain setup verification on contributor machines.
- Market dynamics and tensor helpers remain unimplemented; avoid deriving downstream modules until P1 completes.
